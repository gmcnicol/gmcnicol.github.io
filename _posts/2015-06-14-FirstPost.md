title: Hello, World?

Hello, I'm starting to build the Different Circle web system. 

My goals for the system are quite basic 
+ each site on our roster to be staticially generated using Jekyll or similar.
+ information only needs entered once, and formatted as required where required when required. 
+ to be shared with the world as an open source 'system'

This blog will keep tabs of what steps I've taken so far to get things up and running
